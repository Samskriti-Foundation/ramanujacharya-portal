      "Because the activity imported by the root īksh (to see i.e. to think) is predicated (in relation to what constitutes the cause of the world) that which is not revealed solely by the scripture, (viz. the pradhāna)341 is not (the Sat or the Existence which is referred to in the scriptural passage relating to the cause of the world).\n\nIt has been already stated that that Brahman, who is taught in the scriptural passage which relates to the cause of the world and which begins with -'From whom all these (beings are born)'-[Taitt. Up. III. I. I.], (that Brahman] who is omniscient, who is omnipotent, who is hostile to all that is evil and forms the only seat of all the auspicious qualities,- has to be  enquired into. Now, by means of this aphorism-'Because the activity imported by the root īksh (to see i. e. to think), is predicated (in relation to what constitutes the cause of the world), that which is not revealed solely by the scripture (viz. the pradhāna) is not (the Sat or the Existence which is referred to in the scriptural passage relating to the cause of the world)',  and by means of other aphorisms, it is declared that the scriptural passages342 which mention the cause of the world do not possess the power of denoting the prādhana and other similar things which are capable of being established by the process of logical inference. This is what is revealed in the Chāndogya: ̶ ' Existence alone, my dear child, this was in the beginning, one only, without a second…….. It thought-'May I become manifold and be born'. It created tejas, &c.' [Chhānd. Up. VI. 2. I, 2, et seq.]. Here the doubt arises whether that, which is the cause of the world and is denoted by the word Existence (or Sat), is the pradhana which has been mentioned by others and is capable of being established by logical inference, or whether it is the Brahman who possesses the characteristics already stated?  It is perhaps held343 that it is the pradhāna. Why? The passage-'Existence alone, my dear child, this was in the beginning, one only, &c.'-speaks of the causalcondition of that thing which is denoted by the word 'this', which constitutes the thing to be enjoyed (or endured) by intelligent beings (viz. the individual souls), and which is made up (of the qualities) of sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (darkness), and which (again) exists in variously modified forms such as the ether, &c. Indeed, a thing which exists in the condition of a cause acquires the character of an effect merely by getting into another condition.  Whatever thing and whatever (general) nature (thereof) exist in the condition of a cause, that same thing and that same nature (thereof) exist also in the condition of an effect. Moreover, a produced effect is made up (of the qualities) of sattva, &c. Therefore that pradhāna in which these qualities are held in a state of equilibrium344 is alone the cause (of the universe). That same (pradhāna) is, in the passage  ̶'Existence alone, my dear child, this was in the beginning, one only, without a second', declared to be that undifferentiated existence which has absorbed into itself all differentiating peculiarities. It is for this reason that a cause and its effect have no (essential) difference between them. Only thus can this proposition become appropriate (which says) that, by knowing one thing, all things become known. Otherwise, there would further be a complete difference between the thing intended to be illustrated and the example of the lump of clay and of the produced effects thereof, which are (all) given as an illustration in the scriptural passage that begins with-'Just as, my dear child, by one lump of clay, &c.'- [Chhānd. Up.VI.I.4.].  Therefore, in the scriptural passage which relates to the cause of the world, nothing other than the pradhāna taught by the great sage Kapila is mentioned. Moreover, this passage (now under discussion) contains a proposition and an illustration, and thus it has surely the form of a logical inference. Consequently, what is denoted by the word Existence (or Sat) is nothing other than that (pradhāna) which is capable of being proved by inference (to be the cause of the world).\n\nIf it be so held, it is stated (in reply) thus: ̶ 'Because the activity imported by the root īksh (to see i. e. to think), is predicated (in relation to what constitutes the cause of the world), that which is not revealed solely by the scripture (viz. the pradhāna) is not (the Sat or the Existence which is referred to in the scriptural passage relating to that cause of the world).' That which is not revealed solely by the scripture is that in relation to which the scripture alone does not form the means of proof. It is that which is capable of being established by the process of logical inference. The meaning is that it is the pradhāna. That (pradhānd) is not denoted by the scriptural passages relating to the cause of the world. Why ? Because the activity imported by the root īksh (to see i. e. to think) is predicated.  That is, because the root īksh is used, in the scriptural passage - 'It thought May I become manifoldand be born.'- [Chhānd. Up. VI. 2. 3.], to denote a particular kind of activity in relation to what is imported by the word Existence (or Sat). And it is not possible for the nonintelligent pradhāna to be associated with the activity ofseeing (i. e. of thinking). Therefore, what forms the import of the word Existence (or Sat) is that Highest Person who is capable of so ‘seeing ', and who is a particular intelligent Being that is omniscient and omnipotent. Accordingly, in all contexts which relate to creation, the act of creation isinvariably preceded by the act of 'seeing' (i. e. of thinking), as in the following and other scriptural passages :-'He thought-May I create the worlds'. He created these worlds.' [Ait. Up. I. i & 2.];  'He thought …..  He created the prāṇas.' [Pr. Up. VI. 3 & 4.].\n\nIt may, however, be said here that the cause has necessarily to be in natural conformity with the effect. That is true ; and the Highest Person who is omniscient and omnipotent, who wills the truth, and who owns the intelligent as well as the non-intelligent things in their subtle state as His body, is certainly in natural conformity with all produced effects. For example, the following scriptural passages say the same thing:-'His supreme power is revealed, indeed, as varied, natural, and as consisting of knowledge, strength, and action.' [Svct. Up. VI. 8.];  'He who understands all and who knows all and whose tapas345 consists of knowledge'-[Mund. Up. I.i. 9.];  'He whose body is the avyakta346 whose body is the akshara ….. whose body is mrityu, He is the internal Self of all beings.' [Sub. Up. VII.]. And this will be fully explained under the aphorism-'(The Brahman is) not (the cause of the world), because (He is) different (from this world)' [Ved. Sūt. II. i. 4.], and also under other aphorisms. Here, (however), it is maintained that the scriptural passages relating to the creation of the world are not capable of importing the pradhāna. The logical objections in regard to what actuallyforms the import (of those passages) will be invalidated in that same context (in which this above-mentioned aphorism occurs).\n\nWhat has been stated to the effect that this passage (viz. Chhānd. Up. VI. i & 2.) is decidedly in the form of a logical inference, on account of its containing a proposition and an illustration, - that is not right; because there is not given in it any basis of logical inference ( i.e. the middle term). When, by means of the passage '(Did you ask for that teaching) by which what is not heard becomes heard' [Chhānd. Up. VI. i. 3.], it is desired to teach how by knowing (a certain) one thing all things become known, then, the example (of the clay, &c.,) is indeed made use of merely to show the possibility of such a thing -  to him who is of opinion that such a thing is altogether impossible. As a matter of fact, solely for the reason that the activity imported by the root īksh (to see i. e. to think), is declared (in relation to what forms the cause of the world), it is made out that there is not even the remotest mention of any logical inference (here). \n\nIt may again be said thus:-  It is not that main and natural significance of 'seeing ', which is found to exist in intelligent beings, that is mentioned here ; but, on the other hand, it is a figurative significance of 'seeing' (that is implied here); because, in the following scriptural passages 'That fire saw' [Chhānd. Up. VI. 2. 3.],  “Those waters saw' [Chhānd. Up. VI. 2.4.], there is the association of a figurative 'seeing' (with the pradhāna).  Moreover, it is common to apply figuratively the attributes of intelligent beings to non-intelligent things, as in the instances, 'The paddy crops are expecting the rains',  'By means of the rains the (sown) seed became exceedingly gladdened.'\n\nTherefore, after stating the supposition that the ‘seeing' (here mentioned) may be figurative, he (the Sutrakara) disproves it (thus).",

      "If it be said that it (viz. the import of the root īksh, to see) is (here) figurative, (it is maintained that) it cannot be so; because there is the word Ātman (or Self mentioned in the context).347\n\n What has been stated (above) to the effect that, since there is the association of a figurative 'seeing'(with the pradhāna), this predication of 'seeing' in relation to Existence (or Sat) also is figurative, and is intended to denote that condition (of the pradhāna) which invariably precedes creation, this is not right; because, in the following passage (occurring in that context)- 'All this has That for its Self; That is Existence; That is the Atman (or the Self).' [Chhānd. Up. VI. 8. 7.], - that which is denoted by the word Existence (or Sat) is (also) denoted by the word Ātman (or Self). What is said is this:-That teaching, which is found in the passage “All this has That for its Self. That is the Self.' [Chhānd. Up. VI. 8. 7.], has in view the world which is made up of intelligent and non-intelligent things, and points out that the Sat (or the Existence) is the Self thereof; and it (viz. such a teaching) cannot be appropriately given in relation to the (purely) nonintelligent thing pradhāna. Thus the elements of fire (tejas), water, and earth have also the Highest Self for their Self.  Therefore the words tejas, &c., are also significant of the Highest Self alone.  Accordingly there is the following scriptural passage:  ̶'Indeed entering into these three deities along with this individual self which is (also) the same as Myself, I evolve the differentiation of names and forms.' [Chhānd. Up. VI. 3. 2.]. And from this it follows that tejas and the other elements acquire the character of being things and also the capability of assuming their own particular names wholly as a consequence of the Supreme Self entering into them. Therefore in these statements also, namely,- 'That fire saw';-'Those waters saw'-[Chhānd. Up. VI. 2, 3 & 4.], the predication of 'seeing' has its primary and natural significance.Consequently, in the statement -'It saw' ̶  [Chhānd. Up. VI. 2. 3.], the supposition, which gives a figurative significance (to 'seeing') even as a consequence of the association (of that 'seeing' with the pradhāna), is altogether dispelled (as wrong). Such is the meaning of this aphorism.",

Indeed, in the very beginning of the scriptural passage (under reference), the proposition is enunciated that, by knowing a (certain) single thing, all things become known. And that (proposition,) has to be justified solely by means of the fact that, from the knowledge of the causal Sat (or Existence), the world, which is its produced effect and is made up of the intelligent and the non-intelligent things, becomes known; and the reason (for this) is that a cause and its effect are not different from each other. But the whole collection of intelligent beings (viz. the individual selves) cannot be the effects produced out of the pradhāna; and consequently, by knowing the pradhāna, the knowledge relating to the whole collection of intelligent beings cannot result; thus this (proposition itself) would be contradicted if the pradhāna be taken to be the cause of the world.",

      "This scriptural passage, namely, -'Know from me, my dear child, what deep sleep is. When any person is known to be asleep, he is then in union with the Sat. He withdraws into his own cause.  Therefore they say, he sleeps, because he is absorbed into his own cause (i.e. into the Brahman),'-[Chhānd. Up. VI. 8. i.] - relates to that very subject which is denoted by the word Sat. It declares that the individual soul, who is asleep and is in union with the Sat, has withdrawn (himself) into his own cause; that is, that he has been absorbed into his own cause. And (the) dissolution (of a thing) is (its) absorption into (its) own cause.  Moreover the non-intelligent pradhānadoes not deserve to become the cause of the individual soul. The meaning of the scriptural statement -'He withdraws into his own cause,' - [Chhānd. Up. VI. 8. i.], is that the individual soul goes back only unto the SupremeSelf. It is declared in the scriptural passage351 relating to the differentiation of names and forms that that Brahman Himself, who has the intelligent thing (or the individual soul) for His body and forms its Self, is denoted by the word jīva (which ordinarily means the individual soul). By means of the statement' - He is then in union with the Sat; He withdraws into his own cause.' [Chhānd. Up. VI. 8. i.] - it is taught that that Brahman who is denoted by the word jīva is free from (any) association with names and forms at the time of deep sleep also, as (He is) at the time of universal dissolution; and (He) is hence to be denoted merely by the word Sat (or Existence). To the same effect it is stated in similar contexts (elsewhere) that, owing to his (i. e. the individual self's) not being associated with names and forms, he is embraced by Him who is omniscient; and consequently it is said that,  'When he is embraced by the omniscient Self, he does not know anything that is external nor anything that is internal.' [Bṛih. Up. IV. 3. 21.]. Indeed, untilfinal release takes place, the individual self is associated with names and forms; and it is, therefore, that there is born (in him) the knowledge of objects other than himself.  At the time of deep sleep he certainly gives upnames and forms, and is embraced by the Sat (i. e. by the Brahman):- and again, in the wakeful state, he becomes associated with names and forms and assumes (for himself) a particular name and a particular form. This is clearlystated in other scriptural passages, namely, 'When he (i. e. the individual self) is asleep, he sees no dreams whatsoever; and he becomes one wholly with that Prāṇa (or Brahman] ………………………  From that Self, the prānās proceed each towards its (own,) place.'-[Kaush. Up. IV. 19.].  To the same effect is the following scriptural passage also -'Whatever these beings are here, (i. e. in the state of separation from their cause), whether a tiger, or a lion, or a wolf, or a boar, ……….352 or a fly, or a mosquito,  - that they become again and again.'  [Chhānd. Up. VI. 9. 2. & VI. 10. 2.]. And a similar scriptural text also says that the individual soul who is so in deep sleep 'is embraced by the omniscient Self.'  [Bṛih. Up. IV. 3. 21.]. Therefore, He who is denoted by the word Sat (in the scriptural passage under discussion), is that Highest Person alone who is the Highest Brahman, who is omniscient and is the Highest Lord. The Vṛittikāra (Bodhāyana) says the same thing thus:- 'In the scriptural text -'Then he is in union with the Sat.' this (viz. the fact that the Sat is the Brahman who is the cause of the world) is conclusively made outby means of (the creatures) withdrawing (into the Sat) and returning (from the Sat); and the scripture also says that 'He (the individual self) is  embraced by the omniscient Self.",

      "Because also it is revealed (in the very Upanishad in which the passage under discussion occurs, and in other Upanishads, that the Supreme Self is the cause of the universe).Indeed, in this very Upanishad (viz. the Chhāndogya}, in the following passages, namely,- 'Entering in along with this individual self which is (also) the same as Myself, I evolve the differentiation of names and forms.'-  [Chhānd, Up. VI. 3. 2.], ' All these things which are born, my dear one, have their origin in the Sat (i. e. in the One Existence), have their abode in the Sat, and are established in the Sat.' - [Chhānd. Up. VI. 8. 4 & 6.], 'All this has this (Brahman} for its Self. That (Brahman) is Existence.  He is the Self.' [Chhānd. Up. VI. 8. 7.], 'Whatever there is here as existent and whatever there is as non-existent in relation to him, - all that is contained in Him.' -[Chhānd. Up. VIII. i. 3.], 'In Him, all desires are contained.'-  [Chhānd. Up. VIII. i. 5.], 'This Self is devoid of sin, is free from old age, free from death, free from sorrow,free from hunger, free from thirst, and desires the truth, and wills the truth.'  - [Chhānd. Up. VIII. i. 5. & VIII. 7. i & 3.] it is declared that that, which is denoted by the word Sat, is, in consequence of its possessing the same character as the Self, capable of causing the differentiation of names and forms and possesses (the quality of) omniscience, (the quality of) omnipotence, the quality of being the support of all, the quality of being devoid of sin, &c., the quality of desiring the truth, and also the quality of willing the truth. To the same effect are the following and other scriptural passages found elsewhere also:-  'He has none as His lord and (none) as His ruler in the world; and He has no characteristic body whatsoever. He is the cause and is the Lord of what is the lord of the senses (i. e. of the jīva or the individual soul); He has no progenitor and no superior.'- [Svet. Up. VI. 9.]; 'The omniscient Lord who creates all beings gives them names, and, calling them (by those names), He ever continues to be.' Taitt. Ār. III. 12. 7.]; 'He,who has entered within, is the ruler of all things that are born, and is the Self of all.' [Taitt. Ār. III. 24.]; 'He is the Self of the whole universe and is the best refuge; He is the Lord of the world, the Lord of the individual souls ; whatever thing there is in this world, either seen or heard, Narayana pervades all that within and without and so remains for ever'. - [M. Nār. XI. 3 5.]; 'He is the internal Self of all beings, He is devoid of all sins, He is the Divine Lord, He is the one Narayana.' [Sub. Up. VII. i.].   Therefore the scriptural passage which mentions the cause of the world is not capable of importing (as such) the pradhāna and other similar things.  Consequently it is settled that that Narayana alone who is omniscient and omnipotent, who is the Lord of all lords, who is devoid of even the smallest taint of all that is evil, who is the great ocean that receives the flood of all the collections of (all) the innumerable auspicious qualities which are unsurpassed in excellence, who is the Highest Person, He alone forms the one cause of the universe and is the Brahman that has to be enquired into. For the same reason it has to be understood that the contention, which maintains that the Brahman is pure intelligence devoid of characterising attributes, has also been set at naught by the Sūtrakāra with the help of these(above quoted) scriptural passages; because it is established (by him) that that Brahman, who is to be enquired into, is associated with the real attribute of 'seeing', &c., which forms the main and natural significance of the root īksh, (to 'see'). Indeed, according to the contention which maintains that that (which is the cause of the world) is devoid of characterising attributes, even the character of a witness (i. e. of one who 'sees') has to be unreal (as applied to that cause). That the Brahman, who is to be made out from the Vedānta, has been enunciated to be the object of the enquiry (here), and that He is intelligent, are (both) declared by means of this aphorism among others; namely, 'Because the activity imported by the root īksh (to see i.e. to think] is predicated (in relation to what constitutes the cause of the world), that which is not revealed solely by the scripture (viz. the pradhāna), is not (the Sat or the Existence which is referred to in the scriptural passage relating to that cause of the world).' [Ved. Sūt. I. i. 5.]. To possess the character of an intelligent being is known to be the same as to possess the quality of intelligence.  And accordingly that which is devoid of the attribute of 'seeing' (or thinking) has exactly the same nature as the pradhāna.Moreover, according to the position which maintains that the Brahman is pure luminosity devoid of characterising attributes, it is difficult even to establish that He is (such) luminosity. Luminosity (or intelligence) is indeed known to be that particular thing which is capable of making itself and other things fit to be realised (by the mind). The thing which is devoid of attributes does not possess both these characteristics, and it certainly has in consequence the character of a non-intelligent thing like a pot or any other similar object. If it be said that, even though it does not possess both these characteristics, it is as good as if it had them, it is replied that it cannot be so. To be as good as if it had them is indeed nothing other than (for it) to be able to do what they are capable of doing. On admitting the possession (by the Brahman) of the quality corresponding to this capability, the position which maintains the attributelessness (of the Brahman) will indeed amount to have been given up.  Again, if it be urged that, on the authority of the scripture, this one particular characteristic quality (of capability) has to be admitted, then indeed, for that same reason, omniscience, omnipotence, the quality ofbeing the Lord of all lords, the quality of being the abode of all auspicious attributes, the quality of being hostile to all that is evil, and all other similar qualities will have to be admitted. Again, to possess a capability is the sameas to be able to produce a particular effect; and that (possession of the capability) has to be definitely determined solely by means of (its) produced effect. When (such) a particular produced effect is incapable of being proved,then the possession of that capability, which has to be definitely determined solely by means of that (effect), becomes also incapable of proof.Further, according to him who maintains (the Brahman to be) an attributeless entity, it is impossible to prove (that the Brahman possesses) the character of being a thing at all; for, it has been already355 pointed out that perception, inference, revelation, and one's own experience deal with things which are possessed of attributes.Therefore, it is conclusively established that that Highest Person alone, who is capable of 'seeing' and of willing to the effect356 - ‘May I become manifold in the form of the world which is made up of wonderful intelligent and non-intelligent things', - that (Highest Person alone) is He who has to be enquired into.",
